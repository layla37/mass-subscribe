Mass Subscribe WordPress Plugin

A WordPress plugin to subscribe all users (in a particular role) to a category all at once. To be used with my other plugin [subscribe-email-alert](https://github.com/layla37/subscribe-email-alert)

TODO:
• "owners" needs to be changed to a generic WordPress role.
• "Marketing Forum" needs to be changed to a generic Category
• add capability to specify the role and category in the WordPress dashboard
